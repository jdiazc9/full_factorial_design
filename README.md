The ./data directory contains data for the experiment mixing synthetic colorants (colorants.txt), and for the experiment mixing *Pseudomonas* strains (pseudo.txt).

The ./scripts directory contains the R scripts to produce the panels in the main and supplementary figures. Plots are saved under the ./plots directory. Files description:

**colorants.R**   Produces the panels in Figure 2 & Supplementary Figures 2, 3, and 4.

**pseudo.R**   Produces the panels in Figures 3 and 4.

**pseudo_intxns.R**   Produces the panels in Figure 5 (except for panel 5H) and in Supplementary Figure 6.

**pseudo_taylor_vs_fourier.R**   Produces panel 5H (functional variance by interaction order) and Supplementary Figure 5.

The ./pics directory contains the pictures of the 96-well plates shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
